   * <code>ConfigurationException</code> which describes the problem. This
   * can allow a management system to provide useful information to a human
   * administrator.

   * If this method throws any other <code>Exception</code>, the
   * Configuration Admin service must catch it and should log it.

   * The Configuration Admin service must call this method asynchronously
   * which initiated the callback. This implies that implementors of Managed
   * Service can be assured that the callback will not take place during
   * registration when they execute the registration in a synchronized method.
